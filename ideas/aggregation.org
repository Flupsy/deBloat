* Packet Aggregation is buried deep in the driver
** Idea #1 - expose a large number of hardware queues
mq exposes 4 hardware queues. Instead, expose 128 'hardware' queues
and map stuff into that.
I've seen one hardware driver go by that has 4 threads on it
so you would round robin across the queue types with separate 
threads.

** Flaw - the round robin approach is OK for all but the VO queue,
which can't aggregate.
** Flaw - you end up with a LOT of hardware queues 

* BPFIFO - you really want a fifo limited in both packets and bytes
up to 64 packets or 64k bytes.

* mqprio version
** Filter across the hardware queues
** Fair queue across those queues
