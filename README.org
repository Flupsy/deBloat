* Various scripts for less bufferbloated fair queuing, traffic shaping, etc

The principal item of interest in this repository is the [[file:src/debloat]]
script which incorporates everything I know about how to get reduced latencies under load on wireless and ethernet.

* There are also tests and test results in the test dir

All of varying quality
