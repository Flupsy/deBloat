* Various ad-hoc bufferbloat-related tests I run.

I need to build a comprehensive test infrastructure others can run.

I use the following in various ways. Usually I'll setup iperf to run
10 times in the background, then use things like ping or the TCP_RR test
for netperf or ab (ab is VERY convincing, btw) - and so on.

iperf
netperf
ab (apache benchmark)
ping
fping
shaperprobe

* Design 
** implementation language throughout shall be lua
** data transport: json
** Database analysis: postgres
** web server support - lua again
** graphing/charting tools: unknown

* Ideas
** Netperf is fine, but perhaps we can measure RTT another way
