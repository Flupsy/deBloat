* Summary

This was 50 iperf instances, running for 60 seconds
against a fping -b220 -i 10 -p 10 -C 10000
- in other words a fairly voip-like sample.

I pulled out the 'start of one test' to look
at latency under that load and plotted that
separately as a CDR. Which was nice. Still
a lot of jitter, but...

* Other observations

During this test (under VERY good conditions)

Typically saw 104-110Mbytes/sec and very even
performance from 50 iperfs.

No iperf hangs, either.

High quality streams

And lastly... I did this test over ipv6.

* TODO jitter
* TODO Gather up reference against this kernel combo
(I did a similar test over ipv4 but not on this kernel)
